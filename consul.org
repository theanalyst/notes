* Service Discovery
- Identify running services
- Know host,port etc. for binding to services, eg. DB etc
- Also encompasses Service Registration involving a service
  registering its details
** Examples

Webapp -> Processing -> DB

Obviously you want replicated app

Webapp -> Processing1
	  Processing2
	  Processing3


Webapp -> LB - > Processing(1,2,3)

However we have now introduced a single point of failure

Alternatively,

the app itself is intelligent enough to route the request to the
correct app,

However this introduces problems of health checks, membership etc.

Also how to push a configuration change to every member?

** Problems
- Service Discovery?
- Health Checking
- Configuration Management

** Question
How do various services sync on their activities & come to agree on
the basic information about their environment


* Chubby
- http://research.google.com/archive/chubby.html
- Not an algo paper, very much an engineering paper.  In fact
  excellent use of algorithmic concepts & create a practical system
  usable by many apps
- Coarse grained lock service for loosely coupled distributed systems
- At its core, Paxos (as a service?)
- Later an inspiration for ZK, doozerd, etcd & now consul
